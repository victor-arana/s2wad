    <h1>Sanity check JSP page</h1>

    <p>
      If this page was reached via the <b>sanity.action</b> and
      the project is configured correctly we should see a string
      between these brackets: [<s:property value="sanityCheck" />].
      If the page was reached by directly addressing <b>sanity.jsp</b>
      then nothing will appear.
