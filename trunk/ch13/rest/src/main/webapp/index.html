    <h1>REST Plugin</h1>
    <p>
      This app is a little different; it only has a couple examples: the non-REST
      source is still here in case you want to convert the entire application,
      but I show only a small example.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="/recipe">View recipe list as XML</a></li>
      <li><a href="/recipe.json">View recipe list as JSON</a></li>
      <li><a href="/recipe/1">View single recipe as XML</a></li>
      <li><a href="/recipe/1.json">View single recipe as JSON</a></li>
      <li><a href="/recipe.yaml">View recipe list as YAML</a></li>
      <li><a href="/recipe/1.yaml">View single recipe as YAML</a></li>
      <li><a href="/recipe.xhtml">View recipe list via Ext-JS widget (XML source)</a></li>
    </ul>
